			<h1>My First Car</h1>
			<p>
				I never thought I’d own a 1985 Toyota MR2, but then I bought one. I bought my MR2 from its original owner this summer. The man’s name was Don. Don took such good care of his MR2 over the past 30 years. There is no rust, no rips or tears in the upholstery, and there is only one negligible scratch on the entire car. It’s all original, and only has 125,000 miles. It was one of the cleanest MR2s that I have ever seen on the market.
			<br><br>
				Don is the name of the man who sold me his MR2. Don was looking for someone who could continue to take care of his car for him. Don is an older man, who had shoulder surgery so he could no longer shift the gears in it anymore. Because of this he decided to sell his MR2 to someone else who could enjoy it.
			<br><br>
				I saw that Don was selling his car on craigslist, and so I decided to write him an email expressing my astonishment that there is a 30 year old Toyota in the condition that Don’s was in. I told him that it takes a certain kind of person to appreciate an old Japanese car like that, and that he should be proud to own it. I mentioned that if I had the money that Don was asking for his car, I would buy it in a heartbeat. However, I did not have that kind of money. I let Don know that I was local, and interested in just seeing his car, as it is a pretty rare car. Don replied to me saying he would be more than happy to show his car to another enthusiast, and so we worked out a time to meet.
			<br><br>
				When I went to check out Don’s MR2, I immediately complemented him again on the condition that it was in. Don told me right off the bat that he was surprised to see that I was as young as I was. Don said that I presented myself very professionally online, and he was expecting a much older person to be arriving. I thanked Don for the complement, and we began to talk casually about the car and then each other’s lives. It was really strange. I mean, I had just met this guy and we were having such random conversations about the experiences that we had both been through that made us the people that we are today.
			<br><br>
				Don talked about how he bought his MR2 during a time when he and all his friends were becoming very successful in life. They all were beginning great careers, and all of his friends thought it would be cool to buy different sports cars at this time. Don decided to join in; however, shortly after Don fell ill with a hereditary disease that caused him to need a lung transplant. During this time Don’s wife left him, and took most of what he owned. Fortunately, Don still had his car, but what he really needed was a lung.
			<br><br>
				This was how Don met his second wife. After struggling alone for a few years Don thought that he was as good as dead. His father died of the same disease at his age, and Don accepted the fact that he was going to die too. However, someone matched his rare blood type, and offered to donate her lung. After the transplant, Don started doing much better and wanted to thank his donor. This was how he first met his second wife.
			<br><br>
				I told Don that is a really touching story, and questioned how Don could sell his MR2 after all of that. Don said that he cannot enjoy his car anymore because of his shoulder and age, but Don remembers the joy that it brought him in his time of need. So Don thought he should pass it on to someone who would appreciate it, and could use it.
			<br><br>
				After Don and I talked for a bit more, Don asked me if I would like his car. I said yes, but told him that I could never afford his asking price. Don asked how much money I had to spend on a car, and I told him. Don said that really is not a lot of money, and I told him don’t worry about. I told him he should just try to get what the car is worth. Then Don started saying he didn’t believe that kids like me still existed. I asked Don what he was talking about.
			<br><br>
				Don explained how he is a graduate professor at the University of Chicago, and he deals with young people daily. He said that he hasn’t met someone my age, with a personality like mine in years. Don explained how his graduate students show a lack of honesty. Don claimed that he was depressed because so many of his students plagiarize, and the ones who don’t plagiarize turn in mediocre work. Don said that he was beginning to lose faith that younger generations still had a will to learn for the sake of learning. He said he was really happy to have met me, and he really wanted to sell his car to me and no one else. He told me that he would like to see it go to someone who he can trust with it, and he said he trusts me.
			<br><br>
				I asked Don if he was sure that he wanted to let his car go for such a low price, and he said that he would like to see his car help me out in my life. So I grabbed my money, we signed some papers, and by the end of the day I was driving in my very own car, a 1985 Toyota MR2.
